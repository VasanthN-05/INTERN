    <P>Subhas Chandra Bose shuub-HAHSS CHUN-drə BOHSS;[12] 23 January 1897 – 18 August 1945) was an Indian nationalist
        whose defiance of British authority in India made him a hero among many Indians, but his wartime alliances with
        Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a legacy vexed by authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and military failure.
        The honorific Netaji (Hindi: "Respected Leader") was first applied to Bose in Germany in early 1942—by the
        Indian soldiers of the Indische Legion and by the German and Indian officials in the Special Bureau for India in
        Berlin. It is now used throughout India.Subhas Bose was born into wealth and privilege in a large Bengali family
        in Orissa during the British Raj. The early recipient of an Anglocentric education, he was sent after college to
        England to take the Indian Civil Service examination. He succeeded with distinction in the vital first exam but
        demurred at taking the routine final exam, citing nationalism to be a higher calling. Returning to India in
        1921, Bose joined the nationalist movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress. He followed
        Jawaharlal Nehru to leadership in a group within the Congress which was less keen on constitutional reform and
        more open to socialism.[i] Bose became Congress president in 1938. After reelection in 1939, differences arose
        between him and the Congress leaders, including Gandhi, over the future federation of British India and princely
        states, but also because discomfort had grown among the Congress leadership over Bose's negotiable attitude to
        non-violence, and his plans for greater powers for himself.[15] After the large majority of the Congress Working
        Committee members resigned in protest,[16] Bose resigned as president and was eventually ousted from the
        party.[17][18]</P>

    <P>Subhas Chandra Bose was born to Prabhavati Bose (née Dutt) and Janakinath Bose on 23 January 1897 in Cuttack—in
        what is today the state of Odisha in India, but was then the Orissa Division of Bengal Province in British
        India.[ag][ah] Prabhavati, or familiarly Mā jananī (lit. 'mother'), the anchor of family life, had her first
        child at age 14 and 13 children thereafter. Subhas was the ninth child and the sixth son.[58] Jankinath, a
        successful lawyer and government pleader,[57] was loyal to the government of British India and scrupulous about
        matters of language and the law. A self-made man from the rural outskirts of Calcutta, he had remained in touch
        with his roots, returning annually to his village during the pooja holidays.[59]

        Eager to join his five school-going older brothers, Subhas entered the Baptist Mission's Protestant European
        School in Cuttack in January 1902.[7] English was the medium of all instruction in the school, the majority of
        the students being European or Anglo-Indians of mixed British and Indian ancestry.[56] The curriculum included
        English—correctly written and spoken—Latin, the Bible, good manners, British geography, and British History; no
        Indian languages were taught.[56][7] The choice of the school was Janakinath's, who wanted his sons to speak
        flawless English with flawless intonation, believing both to be important for access to the British in
        India.[60] The school contrasted with Subhas's home, where only Bengali was spoken. At home, his mother
        worshipped the Hindu goddesses Durga and Kali, told stories from the epics Mahabharata and Ramayana, and sang
        Bengali religious songs.[7] From her, Subhas imbibed a nurturing spirit, looking for situations in which to help
        people in distress, preferring gardening around the house to joining in sports with other boys.[8] His father,
        who was reserved in manner and busy with professional life, was a distant presence in a large family, causing
        Subhas to feel he had a nondescript childhood.[61] Still, Janakinath read English literature avidly—John Milton,
        William Cowper, Matthew Arnold, and Shakespeare's Hamlet being among his favourites; several of his sons were to
        become English literature enthusiasts like him.[60]</P>

    <P>Subhas Bose, aged 24, arrived ashore in India at Bombay on the morning of 16 July 1921 and immediately set about
        arranging an interview with Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi, aged 51, was the leader of the non-cooperation movement that
        had taken India by storm the previous year and in a quarter-century would evolve to secure its
        independence.[ai][aj] Gandhi happened to be in Bombay and agreed to see Bose that afternoon. In Bose's account
        of the meeting, written many years later, he pilloried Gandhi with question after question.[82] Bose thought
        Gandhi's answers were vague, his goals unclear, his plan for achieving them not thought through.[82] Gandhi and
        Bose differed in this first meeting on the question of means—for Gandhi non-violent means to any end were
        non-negotiable; in Bose's thought, all means were acceptable in the service of anti-colonial ends.[82] They
        differed on the question of ends—Bose was attracted to totalitarian models of governance, which were
        anathematized by Gandhi.According to historian Gordon, "Gandhi, however, set Bose on to the leader of the
        Congress and Indian nationalism in Bengal, C. R. Das, and in him Bose found the leader whom he sought."[82] Das
        was more flexible than Gandhi, more sympathetic to the extremism that had attracted idealistic young men such as
        Bose in Bengal.[82] Das launched Bose into nationalist politics.[82] Bose would work within the ambit of the
        Indian National Congress politics for nearly 20 years even as he tried to change its course.[82]

        He started the newspaper Swaraj and took charge of publicity for the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee.[84]
        His mentor was Chittaranjan Das who was a spokesman for aggressive nationalism in Bengal. In the year 1923, Bose
        was elected the President of Indian Youth Congress and also the Secretary of Bengal State Congress. He was also
        the editor of the newspaper "Forward", founded by Chittaranjan Das.[85] Bose worked as the CEO of the Calcutta
        Municipal Corporation for Das when the latter was elected mayor of Calcutta in 1924.[86] During the same year,
        when he was leading a protest march in Calcutta, he along with Maghfoor Ahmad Ajazi and other leaders were
        arrested and put behind bars.[87] In a roundup of nationalists in 1925, Bose was arrested and sent to prison in
        Mandalay, where he contracted tuberculosis.[88]

        Indian National Congress, 29 December 1928
        In 1927, after being released from prison, Bose became general secretary of the Congress party and worked with
        Jawaharlal Nehru for independence. In late December 1928, Bose organised the Annual Meeting of the Indian
        National Congress in Calcutta.[89] His most memorable role was as General officer commanding (GOC) Congress
        Volunteer Corps.[89] Author Nirad Chaudhuri wrote about the meeting:<br>Bose organized a volunteer corps in
        uniform, its officers were even provided with steel-cut epaulettes ... his uniform was made by a firm of British
        tailors in Calcutta, Harman's. A telegram addressed to him as GOC was delivered to the British General in Fort
        William and was the subject of a good deal of malicious gossip in the (British Indian) press. Mahatma Gandhi as
        a sincere pacifist vowed to non-violence, did not like the strutting, clicking of boots, and saluting, and he
        afterward described the Calcutta session of the Congress as a Bertram Mills circus, which caused a great deal of
        indignation among the Bengalis.</P>

        <img src="b7.jpg"><br><br>
            <P>In Germany, he was attached to the Special Bureau for India under Adam von Trott zu Solz which was responsible for broadcasting on the German-sponsored Azad Hind Radio.[109] He founded the Free India Center in Berlin, and created the Indian Legion (consisting of some 4500 soldiers) out of Indian prisoners of war who had previously fought for the British in North Africa prior to their capture by Axis forces. The Indian Legion was attached to the Wehrmacht, and later transferred to the Waffen SS. Its members swore the following allegiance to Hitler and Bose: "I swear by God this holy oath that I will obey the leader of the German race and state, Adolf Hitler, as the commander of the German armed forces in the fight for India, whose leader is Subhas Chandra Bose". This oath clearly abrogated control of the Indian legion to the German armed forces whilst stating Bose's overall leadership of India. He was also, however, prepared to envisage an invasion of India via the USSR by Nazi troops, spearheaded by the Azad Hind Legion; many have questioned his judgment here, as it seems unlikely that the Germans could have been easily persuaded to leave after such an invasion, which might also have resulted in an Axis victory in the War.[107]

                Soon, according to historian Romain Hayes, "the (German) Foreign Office procured a luxurious residence for (Bose) along with a butler, cook, gardener, and an SS-chauffeured car. Emilie Schenkl moved in openly with him. The Germans, aware of the nature of the relationship, refrained from any involvement."[110] However, most of the staff in the Special Bureau for India, which had been set up to aid Bose, did not get along with Emilie.[111] In particular Adam von Trott, Alexander Werth and Freda Kretschemer, according to historian Leonard A. Gordon, "appear to have disliked her intensely. They believed that she and Bose were not married and that she was using her liaison with Bose to live an especially comfortable life during the hard times of war" and that differences were compounded by issues of class.[111] In November 1942, Schenkl gave birth to their daughter.
                
                The Germans were unwilling to form an alliance with Bose because they considered him unpopular in comparison with Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru.[23][24] By the spring of 1942, the German army was mired in the USSR. Bose, due to disappointment over the lack of response from Nazi Germany, was now keen to move to Southeast Asia, where Japan had just won quick victories. However, he still expected official recognition from Nazi Germany. Adolf Hitler during his only meeting with Bose in late May 1942 refused to entertain Bose's requests and facilitated him with a submarine voyage to East Asia.[26][27][28]</P>

            <P>Subhas Chandra Bose's death occurred from third-degree burns on 18 August 1945 after his overloaded Japanese plane crashed in Japanese-ruled Formosa (now Taiwan).[123][40][4][5] However, many among his supporters, especially in Bengal, refused at the time, and have refused since, to believe either the fact or the circumstances of his death.[123][41][42] Conspiracy theories appeared within hours of his death and have thereafter had a long shelf life,[123][am] keeping alive various martial myths about Bose.[48]

                In Taihoku, at around 2:30 pm as the bomber with Bose on board was leaving the standard path taken by aircraft during take-off, the passengers inside heard a loud sound, similar to an engine backfiring.[124][125] The mechanics on the tarmac saw something fall out of the plane.[126] It was the portside engine, or a part of it, and the propeller.[126][124] The plane swung wildly to the right and plummeted, crashing, breaking into two, and exploding into flames.[126][124] Inside, the chief pilot, copilot and Lieutenant-General Tsunamasa Shidei, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, who was to have made the negotiations for Bose with the Soviet army in Manchuria,[127] were instantly killed.[126][128] Bose's assistant Habibur Rahman was stunned, passing out briefly, and Bose, although conscious and not fatally hurt, was soaked in gasoline.[126] When Rahman came to, he and Bose attempted to leave by the rear door, but found it blocked by the luggage.[128] They then decided to run through the flames and exit from the front.[128] The ground staff, now approaching the plane, saw two people staggering towards them, one of whom had become a human torch.[126] The human torch turned out to be Bose, whose gasoline-soaked clothes had instantly ignited.[128] Rahman and a few others managed to smother the flames, but also noticed that Bose's face and head appeared badly burned.[128] According to Joyce Chapman Lebra, "A truck which served as ambulance rushed Bose and the other passengers to the Nanmon Military Hospital south of Taihoku."[126] The airport personnel called Dr. Taneyoshi Yoshimi, the surgeon-in-charge at the hospital at around 3 pm.[128] Bose was conscious and mostly coherent when they reached the hospital, and for some time thereafter.[129] Bose was naked, except for a blanket wrapped around him, and Dr. Yoshimi immediately saw evidence of third-degree burns on many parts of the body, especially on his chest, doubting very much that he would live.[129] Dr. Yoshimi promptly began to treat Bose and was assisted by Dr. Tsuruta.[129] According to historian Leonard A. Gordon, who interviewed all the hospital personnel later,</P>
